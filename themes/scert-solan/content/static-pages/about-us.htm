<p>College of School Education was established in Solan in 1954. Converted into State Institute of Education (SIE) in 1970. SIE was entrusted the task of preparing programmes and policies from Primary Level to Senior Secondary Level by the State Government. SIE was restructured as SCERT on the pattern of NCERT in 1984. SCERT was converted into society in 1997 with a provision of grants-in-aid by the Government. The grants-in-aid was not released well in time hence the staff remained without salary for months together. In view of the above difficulties State Government reviewed the situation and agreed to meet the salary and other requirements like office expenses, travelling expenses from the budget of Higher Education. Budgetary allocation by the Government is hardly enough to qualify for functional autonomy hence its status and role has been reduced to any other Educational Institution.</p>
